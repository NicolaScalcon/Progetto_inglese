        <h2>Personal Introduction:</h2><br>
        My name is <strong>Nicola Scalcon</strong>. I am 18 years old and I attend the fifth year of the Technical Institute Enrico Fermi in Bassano del Grappa, Computer Science program.
        
        <h2>Character and Attitudes:</h2><br>
        I am a very <strong>determined</strong> person, so if there is a goal to achieve I want to reach it at all costs, setting <strong>objectives</strong> and trying to find effective solutions.<br>
        I am <strong>generous and altruistic</strong>; if someone asks me for help, I try to support them with the resources I have available.<br>
        I love <strong>teamwork</strong>; by playing football I am used to it and I also enjoy being the <strong>leader</strong> of the team.<br> 
        I am detail-oriented, <strong>precise</strong>, and attentive to deadlines.<br>
        I enjoy developing <strong>new skills</strong>.
        
        <h2>Main Interests:</h2><br>
            <h4><u>Football: </u></h4> I have practiced this sport since the age of 5, an experience that taught me discipline, team spirit, and the ability to manage challenges.<br>
            <h4><u>Computer Science and Programming: </u></h4> I am fascinated by the digital world, particularly the technical side of programming. I like to deepen my knowledge of languages and tools because I believe technology is a key factor in innovating and improving work processes.<br>
            <h4><u>Relationship with Children: </u></h4> I have a natural predisposition to be with younger kids, a quality I was able to put into practice as a summer camp animator. This experience allowed me to develop organizational, communication, and leadership skills.<br>
            <h4><u>Music: </u></h4> Listening to and exploring different musical genres stimulates my creativity and concentration. Music represents for me a means of expression and personal balance.<br>
